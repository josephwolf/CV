### Developer, Nerd & Ne'er do-well

## Bio
Hi! I'm Joey and I'm a huge nerd.
When I was 11, my friends and I would often talk about video games and we'd come up with ideas about what sort of game we would make. At some point I decided this was an unrealistic idea and for some reason life as a professional artist was a much safer bet.  
This went almost as badly as one might expect, though I was briefly featured in a gallery in Brixton in 2005. After finishing some travel and a small Art degree, the economy was looking scary and I decided to work in catering while waiting for the situation to improve.  
A recession later I was still in the same job. I'd been offered to try out for being a manager more than once, but turned it down because the one thing I was sure about was this was definitely not what I wanted to do with myself. I started to re-assess what I was doing.  
I started thinking about those conversations I'd had as a kid, wondered why it never occurred to me to take the direct route towards the games industry. So I decided to learn how to program.  
When I did, many of my friends told me I should really have done that years ago, because I've the right mind for it. When I started my course at Makers Academy, I was quite surprised to discover they were right. I started learning very quickly and enjoyed it immensely, especially front-end web development. From there I was lucky enough to have a contact at a new startup called Crowdmix, where I got to work along-side some coding heavy-weights, and experience first hand an Agile work-place, with many XP practices.

Over a relatively short space of time, I've picked up an extremely broard range of skills. I try not to be intimidated by large tasks or unfamiliar tech. I feel the most important thing in a workplace is creativity and a positive attitude. Everything else that's important - productivity, communication, sustainability - tend to follow from that. 
More recently I find myself trying to understand more abstract concepts such as scalability and data archetecture, and actually understand what they mean and how they work, rather than merely acknowledge trendy buzzwords.

## Experience

#### Tagmix
Full Stack Web Developer (2017 - present)

Much like the similarly named (but unrelated) Crowdmix, I was brought on to the team as a web developer. With a grand total of 5 people in the company, my responsibilities covered almost anything web related. Tagmix was another music app with a social focus, and I was responsible for the public facing **Wordpress** site, as well as developing internal tools, database management, email integrations, and data analysis.

As well as the Wordpress site (which you can sample at: http://tagmix.me/), I developed an internal tool for monitoring and reviewing user content using **React** and **Redux**. The learning curve on these frameworks was admittedly steep, but I'm increasingly coming to terms understanding the benefits of its compartmentalized structure and event flow.
As more and more features were requested, I began working more extensively with **AWS Lambda** and **AWS API Gateway** to create various microservices that would do things like query a **Firebase** data set, read, write and delete from email subscription lists, generate static webpages for redirection to appropriate app download pages, or routinely update analytics tools with fresh user data. I've made perhaps 25 microservices in this way, and enjoy how compact and scalable they are.

I've done a significant amount of data analysis too, using **MySql** (my least favourite SQL flavour so far), and visualizing the data using tools such as **Geckoboard** and **Quicksight**. Much discussion was made regarding how analysis data should be collected, propagated and visualized, and I started developing an understanding of what 'clean' data should look like.
Being the sole web developer, I was also left largely in charge of the cosmetic side of the sites. Wordpress, I've learned is something you must often wrestle with in this regard, unless you start writing plugins yourself or want to pay a significant amount of money, but there's all kinds of tricks to fool it into behaving how you want.

#### Jaunt.ai
NLP trainer and Developer (2016)

After my time at Crowdmix, I was picked up by a relatively tiny startup that aspired to be a holiday planning app, that interacted via chat recognition. I learned how to use and program Google's API.AI NLP service, and worked extensively to develop the logical flow of conversation with the robot. Despite being a very user-facing technology, some of the challenges were complex and fascinating. A high point was when I diagrammed out the entire conversation that persisted multiple contexts. Eventually, Google introduced new features to the service to deal with some of the issues I had already solved, though my solution proved more reliable.

My time with Jaunt only lasted a few months before the project was ultimately abandoned due to management issues. :(

#### Crowdmix
Web developer, Server Developer, Internal Developer, Code Security Officer, QA Tester and Data Analyst (2015 - 2016)

Crowdmix was a promising startup to create a social network app that focused on music. This was my first real tech job was probably the best I could have hoped for, in terms of experience. Outside of the founders themselves, I was the only developer to have seen the company all the way through from its creation, to eventual collapse into administration.
During my time there I had several official roles, and even more unofficial ones. I helped with the feature design, the database structure, developer operations, design work, even arranged the parties. 

Initially, I was brought on as a **web developer** for a few months to make 'quick n' dirty' proof of concept sites for the app. In those early steps, there were few enough of us that everyone did a bit of everything, and we'd debate on how a social network should work, and what it should look like. However once 3 months had passed (the time they had agreed to keep me around for) they asked me to stay and work on server code. This was initially in **Java**, but as every Java expert we hired was a **Scala** fanatic, it was eventually decided to migrate the structure over. I would tend to pair with senior developers, occasionally on my own with less time-critical pieces of functionality.

As the code base, staff and notoriety as a promising startup grew, **security** grew to be a larger concern, and I was enlisted by the Chief Secuity Officer to start regular **code review** to look for shared secrets that may have been committed, or spot other obvious vulnerabilities. I was his 'man on the inside'. With literally millions of lines to go over, I had to make several **Bash scripts** to automate this process.

After a year and a bit, resources for the company where starting to dwindle, and may roles had to be re-assigned, or lost. As such, I was placed in a more strategic role - developing internal web tools using **AngularJS** so developers would be able to get a clear overview of the over all structure of the code base, and avoid version conflicts. At the same time, I was also working on small **Raspberry Pi** projects around the office. 

As more jobs were lost and teams became under-resourced, I was moved onto data analysis, where I was thrown into the deep end of **SQL** and **Mode Analytics**. Initially, I thought I'd be poorly suited to the work, but in fact there was a great deal of detective work to find data anomalies and user behavior.

Sadly, after a little under 2 years, plans for funding started to fall through, and we were advised to stop working till further notice. A month later, the remaining staff were told they were made redundant, developers, CEO and all.
In every role I've had, I've had to learn new skills with little preparation. I've learned that great coders are fearless and adaptable. Compromise can sometimes be difficult when passion for your code conflicts with what the business demands, but with no middle ground, everyone suffers for it.
 
#### Paramount, Center Point
Kitchen Runner & Events Waiter (2009 - 2014)

Work was physically demanding, fast-paced and with little room for error. Though far from glamorous, I learned many skills including teamwork, quick judgment decision making, clear and concise communication and above all, customer satisfaction. I can also make a decent cappuccino.

I didn't like this job very much. The hours were as unsocial as you can get and chefs occasionally threw plates at your head.

## Education
#### Makers Academy (March Cohort 2014)

Makers Academy is an intensive course that teaches the principles of object oriented programming and agile and XP practices in equal measure. The course focuses on the Ruby on Rails framework and full stack web development.

In truth, the language and framework used are almost incidental. What they truly focus on is how to think like a programmer, and how to work with a team. TDD methodology and Pair Programming were extremely rigorous, to the point where any untested lines would be deleted outright. The course was short, but intense, and covered a wide range of technologies, including;  
⦁	Git, GitHub, Bash and the basics  
⦁	Ruby(2.1) and Ruby on Rails(4)  
⦁	PostGreSQL  
⦁	The HTML, CSS and Javascript trinity  
⦁	HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and jQuery  
⦁	RSpect, Jasmine, Capybara and Cucumber testing suites  
⦁	API intergation with Twilio and Stripe  
⦁	basic OAuth and OAuth2 authentication and encryption   
⦁	Heroku intergration and deployment  

#### University of Creative Arts, Maidstone
Foundation: Fine art (2008 - 2009)

Covered a very wide breadth of fields including fashion, design, illustration, printing and contemporary art. How to work on a freelance or contracted environment and deliver professional standards of work. Portfolio available if you want it. 

## Other Skills
#### Painting and Illustration
That degree has to be good for something! I only really draw for fun these days and I'm on the rusty side, but I'm happy when I'm creating things.
#### Lockpicking
Don't get any funny ideas. It's just a hobby. Strangely, this has a pretty large crossover with the programmer and hacker community. Occasionally comes in useful for locked desk draws and the like.
#### DIY Craftwork
I have a knack for putting things together, and fixing mechanical problems that I run into here and there.
#### Videogames. Yeah, all of them.
Maybe not all of them. I was never great at fighter games or RTSs. Some of my favorites include Dark Souls, Undertale, The Stanley Parable, The Elder Scrolls, Borderlands and Bioshock.

## Extra Activities
#### SoCraTes UK 2015
A fantastic un-conference near Guildford where developers discuss their passion, best practices, run workshops and demonstrations and have fun.
#### London Scala Users' Group
A regular meetup in London for Scala developers to workshop, exchange katas and projects, and discuss technique and practice.
#### London Gaymers
A London-based games group for LGBT men to relax, have fun, and provide a safe environment to unwind and be yourself.
#### HackSpace London
Somewhere between a grassroots collective and a mad science laboratory. HackSpace provides workshops, tools, tutorials and space for all manner of hardware and software projects.
#### Hacker Olympics 2014
Team Tigella came in 11th place! Claim to fame: Scored 3 points before the hosts had finished explaining the rules.
