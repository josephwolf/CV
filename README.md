### Developer, Nerd & Ne'er do-well

## Bio
Hi! I'm Joey and I'm a huge nerd.
I've always been a huge nerd, but for a long time I thought programming meant something artless, soulless, and without compromise, so for much of my young adulthood I ignored many of my friends who observed I had a brilliantly technical and analytical mind. Instead, I wanted to be an artist.
One small gallery exhibition (Brixton 2005), and 7 years of catering industry later, I was having second thoughts.
By now, two exes, three friends, and my flatmate were all programmers, and collectively they convinced me to give his computer malarkey a go. To nobody's surprise except mine, I was not only pretty good at it, I really enjoyed it.

I signed up for an intensive coding bootcamp; Maker's Academy. Less of a school, more a kind of mad experiment to turn every human into a programmer. Within the space of a week you might be exposed to a dozen languages, frameworks and libraries. The focus was less on the basest level of technical understanding (though that too was sometimes included) and more on what was universally true for all programming.
Interestingly, perhaps half of the course was on code *practice* rather than coding itself. Agile methodology, pair programming, and a zealous insistence on Test Driven Development.

Since graduating I've been an integral part of 4 startups of various sizes, doing nearly every kind of technical job I can think of at least once. I'm often asked 'What sort of programmer are you?' or 'What kind of coding do you prefer?' 'Front end or back end?'.
I've never not been a full-stack guy. I believe at the end of the day, development is the same, no matter how close to the metal you are. Sometimes a front-end dev needs to know how to re-arrange a server or construct a database. Sometimes a back-end needs to understand the limitations of what can be rendered, or proper API etiquette. As I've grown more experienced, I've learned what's common across frameworks and languages and what isn't.
If you can do a little bit of everything, even the things you don't know get easier to understand.

I'm always excited about the future. I'm finally good enough with one language (javascript) to consider it my 'base' and can lean on it for preference if asked - which was a goal I had set for myself a few years back. 
What's the new goal? Working in tiny startups is fantastic fun, but they care about 'fast' not 'rigorous process'. It's time to go back to producing the cleanest code possible and doing proper TDD.

## Experience

#### Tagmix
Full Stack Web Developer (2017 - present)

Much like the similarly named (but unrelated) Crowdmix, I was brought on to the team as a web developer. With a grand total of 5 people in the company, my responsibilities covered almost anything web related. Tagmix was another music app with a social focus, and I was responsible for the public facing **Wordpress** site, as well as developing internal tools, database management, email integrations, and data analysis.

As well as the Wordpress site (which you can sample at: http://tagmix.me/), I developed an internal tool for monitoring and reviewing user content using **React** and **Redux**. The learning curve on these frameworks was admittedly steep, but I'm increasingly coming to terms understanding the benefits of its compartmentalized structure and event flow.
As more and more features were requested, I began working more extensively with **AWS Lambda** and **AWS API Gateway** to create various microservices that would do things like query a **Firebase** data set, read, write and delete from email subscription lists, generate static webpages for redirection to appropriate app download pages, or routinely update analytics tools with fresh user data. I've made perhaps 40 microservices in this way, and enjoy how compact and scalable they are.

I've done a significant amount of data analysis too, using **MySql** (my least favourite SQL flavour so far), and visualizing the data using tools such as **Geckoboard** and **Quicksight**. Much discussion was made regarding how analysis data should be collected, propagated and visualized, and I started developing an understanding of what 'clean' data should look like.
Being the sole web developer, I was also left largely in charge of the cosmetic side of the sites. Wordpress, I've learned is something you must often wrestle with in this regard, unless you start writing plugins yourself or want to pay a significant amount of money, but there's all kinds of tricks to fool it into behaving how you want.

#### Jaunt.ai
NLP trainer and Developer (2016)

After my time at Crowdmix, I was picked up by a relatively tiny startup that aspired to be a holiday planning app, that interacted via chat recognition. I learned how to use and program Google's API.AI NLP service, and worked extensively to develop the logical flow of conversation with the robot. Despite being a very user-facing technology, some of the challenges were complex and fascinating. A high point was when I diagrammed out the entire conversation that persisted multiple contexts. Eventually, Google introduced new features to the service to deal with some of the issues I had already solved, though my solution proved more reliable.

My time with Jaunt only lasted a few months before the project was ultimately abandoned due to management issues. :(

#### Crowdmix
Web developer, Server Developer, Internal Developer, Code Security Officer, QA Tester and Data Analyst (2015 - 2016)

Crowdmix was a promising startup to create a social network app that focused on music. This was my first real tech job was probably the best I could have hoped for, in terms of experience. Outside of the founders themselves, I was the only developer to have seen the company all the way through from its creation, to eventual collapse into administration.
During my time there I had several official roles, and even more unofficial ones. I helped with the feature design, the database structure, developer operations, design work, even arranged the parties. 

Initially, I was brought on as a **web developer** for a few months to make 'quick n' dirty' proof of concept sites for the app. In those early steps, there were few enough of us that everyone did a bit of everything, and we'd debate on how a social network should work, and what it should look like. However once 3 months had passed (the time they had agreed to keep me around for) they asked me to stay and work on server code. This was initially in **Java**, but as every Java expert we hired was a **Scala** fanatic, it was eventually decided to migrate the structure over. I would tend to pair with senior developers, occasionally on my own with less time-critical pieces of functionality.

As the code base, staff and notoriety as a promising startup grew, **security** grew to be a larger concern, and I was enlisted by the Chief Secuity Officer to start regular **code review** to look for shared secrets that may have been committed, or spot other obvious vulnerabilities. I was his 'man on the inside'. With literally millions of lines to go over, I had to make several **Bash scripts** to automate this process.

After a year and a bit, resources for the company where starting to dwindle, and may roles had to be re-assigned, or lost. As such, I was placed in a more strategic role - developing internal web tools using **AngularJS** so developers would be able to get a clear overview of the over all structure of the code base, and avoid version conflicts. At the same time, I was also working on small **Raspberry Pi** projects around the office. 

As more jobs were lost and teams became under-resourced, I was moved onto data analysis, where I was thrown into the deep end of **SQL** and **Mode Analytics**. Initially, I thought I'd be poorly suited to the work, but in fact there was a great deal of detective work to find data anomalies and user behavior.

Sadly, after a little under 2 years, plans for funding started to fall through, and we were advised to stop working till further notice. A month later, the remaining staff were told they were made redundant, developers, CEO and all.
In every role I've had, I've had to learn new skills with little preparation. I've learned that great coders are fearless and adaptable. Compromise can sometimes be difficult when passion for your code conflicts with what the business demands, but with no middle ground, everyone suffers for it.
 
#### Paramount, Center Point
Kitchen Runner & Events Waiter (2009 - 2014)

Work was physically demanding, fast-paced and with little room for error. Though far from glamorous, I learned many skills including teamwork, quick judgment decision making, clear and concise communication and above all, customer satisfaction. I can also make a decent cocktail.

For the record, I *could* have gone for a manager position here, but I don't hate myself that much. The hours were unsocial, the chefs occasionally threw plates at your head, people looked at you funny if you liked Pokemon.

## Education
#### Makers Academy (March Cohort 2014)

Makers Academy is an intensive course that teaches the principles of object oriented programming and agile and XP practices in equal measure. The course focuses on the Ruby on Rails framework and full stack web development.

In truth, the language and framework used are almost incidental. What they truly focus on is how to think like a programmer, and how to work with a team. TDD methodology and Pair Programming were extremely rigorous, to the point where any untested lines would be deleted outright. The course was short, but intense, and covered a wide range of technologies, including;  
⦁	Git, GitHub, Bash and the basics  
⦁	Ruby(2.1) and Ruby on Rails(4)  
⦁	PostGreSQL  
⦁	The HTML, CSS and Javascript trinity  
⦁	HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and jQuery  
⦁	RSpect, Jasmine, Capybara and Cucumber testing suites  
⦁	API intergation with Twilio and Stripe  
⦁	basic OAuth and OAuth2 authentication and encryption   
⦁	Heroku intergration and deployment  

#### University of Creative Arts, Maidstone
Foundation: Fine art (2008 - 2009)

Covered a very wide breadth of fields including fashion, design, illustration, printing and contemporary art. How to work on a freelance or contracted environment and deliver professional standards of work. Portfolio available if you want it. 

## Other Skills
#### Painting and Illustration
That degree has to be good for something! I only really draw for fun these days and I'm on the rusty side, but I'm happy when I'm creating things.
#### Lockpicking
Don't get any funny ideas. It's just a hobby. Strangely, this has a pretty large crossover with the programmer and hacker community. Occasionally comes in useful for locked desk draws and the like.
#### DIY Craftwork
I have a knack for putting things together, and fixing mechanical problems that I run into here and there.
#### Videogames. Yeah, all of them.
Maybe not all of them. I was never great at fighter games or RTSs. Some of my favorites include Dark Souls, Undertale, The Stanley Parable, The Elder Scrolls, Borderlands and Bioshock.

## Extra Activities
####  London JavaScript Community
A regular meetup in London for JavaScript developers to workshop, exchange katas and projects, and discuss technique and practice.
#### Queer Code London
If you like a little diversity in your team (and who doesn't!) I like to say active in LGBT+ communities. The content is much like any other code group, but it's good to have another thing in common.
#### HackSpace London
Somewhere between a grassroots collective and a mad science laboratory. HackSpace provides workshops, tools, tutorials and space for all manner of hardware and software projects.
#### SoCraTes UK 
A fantastic un-conference near Guildford where developers discuss their passion, best practices, run workshops and demonstrations and have fun.
#### Hacker Olympics 2014
Team Tigella came in 11th place! Claim to fame: Scored 3 points before the hosts had finished explaining the rules.
